Title: Quadratic Forms in Large Matrices
Version: 1.5
Author: Thomas Lumley
Maintainer: Thomas Lumley <t.lumley@auckland.ac.nz>
Description: A computationally-efficient leading-eigenvalue approximation to tail probabilities and quantiles of large quadratic forms, in particular for the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) used in genomics <doi:10.1002/gepi.22136>. Also provides stochastic singular value decomposition for dense or sparse matrices.
